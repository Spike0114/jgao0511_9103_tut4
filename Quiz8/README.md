## Part1 

I would want to discuss the "audio visualization" technology, particularly the dynamic image creation using sound frequency. This approach can translate auditory information into visual effects, hence simplifying user-musical interaction. Users' absorption and involvement can be raised by matching the rhythm and tone of sound to graphic aspects including form, color, and motion. This technology completely uses the emotional expression of music and generates interesting interactive experiences, hence it is quite appropriate for my project.
